## Bootstrapping

Here is the script you need to run to get this working:

> [!IMPORTANT] You will need to have an SSH key to authorize GitHub with, and
> have access to the Ghostty GitHub repository as I use Ghostty and Ghostty is
> in private beta at the moment.

```sh
sudo nix-shell --packages git nu nix-output-monitor --command "
  git clone https://github.com/orhnk/dotnix ~/nix
  cd ~/nix
  nu rebuild.nu <host>
"
```

`host` is a host selected from the hosts in the `hosts` directory.

## Applying Changes

Lets say you have changed the configuration and want to apply the changes to
your system. You would have to run the rebuild script:

```sh
./rebuild.nu
```

This runs the script interactively.

You can also check how the script is used:

```sh
./rebuild.nu --help
```

This outputs:

```
Usage:
  > rebuild.nu (host) ...(arguments)

Flags:
  -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

Parameters:
  host <string>: The host to build. (optional, default: '')
  ...arguments <any>: The arguments to pass to `nix system apply`.
```

## TIPS

### Productivity

Feeling unproductive and ricing your NixOS all day? I was one. Then I've found
out that using a somewhat ugly was helping me. So you can use the "Productive"
theme under the flake instead of the one that's aesthetic.

#### Monochrome

Monochrome display is probably one of the most productive thing ever. Use your
GPU's official settings (nvidia-settings for my setup). Or you can adjust your
colors using third party apps like xcalib, xgamma, redshift etc. (if you can't
achieve monochrome, use green-only or similar settings using your monitor's
local hardware settings)

## NOTES

### My System Is Running Out Of Space ...

```sh
nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 3d # delete older than 3 days
nix-store --gc
nix-store --gc --print-roots | grep ~ # If this has so many outputs, you need to delete older profiles manually and recollect garbage. (really helpful if your system is old)
nix-store --verify --repair
nix store optimise
```

you could also use `nix-tree` to judge which package is needed or not.

I also suggest using the package `dua`. call `dua interactive` on `/` and
navigate through your volumed directories.

### Errors

If there are any collision errors on your setup. You probably have both
home-manager and nix's default packages enabled. So choose one and disable the
other.

### Accidentally Deleted Files bla bla.

Always backup your data. You should probably use `git` here. Anyways as I did
such a dumb thing and moved a week older version of my dotfiles, thanks to
@mr_headroom on discord, I was able to recover my latest rebuild. Note that you
should made the `rebuild-switch` action to retrieve the latest rebuild. If not,
I'm not sure that you can recover your config. Here is how I did it:

#### Nix Store

Everything that has to do with your configuration is store in the nix store. So
your configuration is copied up there when a change is made and rebuilt on your
configuration. First, I searched the dir for config generations using
`fd /nix/store/*-source/`. This will puke every generation copied to nix store.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Output of `df /nix/store/*-source/` will be huge. It includes every generation

> filtering like below.

#### Judging which one is the latest rebuild

Nix (AFAIK) doesn't have a way to tell which generation is the latest. So you
should judge it by the filetree present in the generation. I have a file that I
have lately added to my configuration: `modules/udisks.nix` so I searched for
configurations that have that file. This lead to only several files:

```sh

#### Judge by File Content

last of my edits didn't have a new file so I needed to check the content of the
files. I used the following script which also shows how the generations got
shrinked by the time:
