= MERGE MIR (MgMIR) =

Merge uses a Middle Intermediate Representation to make it easier to maintain package manager specific features.

1. Syntax

Some examples of merge command MIR:

	merge  install <package_list>
	merge --upgrade-packages
	merge  upgrade <package_list>
	merge   search <package_list>
	merge   remove <package_list>

2. Philosophy

MgMIR tries to be unambigious as possible. This way It's all declarative and 100% reproducible.

Initial try for Merge was to use a parser to parse the shell cmd into It's components. Next construct a MIR,
Then translate the MIR into the package manager representation.

3. Components of MgMIR

3.1 Keywords

<package_list>   substituted with the package name(s) used for the action

3.2 Opts

install <package_list>
update <package_list>
search <package_list>
remove <package_list>

3.3 Args

--upgrade-packages

3.4 Mixed

install <package_list> --upgrade-packages

3.5 Rules

Every component has optional raw_arguments that doesn't require a keyword to get substituted (unline a `<package_list>`)

- TODO: some components should be ovewritable
