Ved - a fast Vim-like editor written in V.

Ved works best with workspaces (directories with code).
You can have multiple workspaces and quickly switch between them with `C [` and `C ]`.

To open multiple workspaces, run

ved path/to/project1 path/to/project2

If you never used vim before press `j` to move down

Key bindings:

"C" means the Apple key on macOS, control key on all other systems.
